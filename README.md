# PredictiveModelforBank
Project on supervised machine learning model to predict future income of individual.

Bank client wants to target new potential customers, especially young adults opening their first bank account. 
More specifically, your company wants to target prospects that are most likely to have high incomes later in life.
In order to fulfill this request, a model to predict a person's future income should be created
